    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am 17 years old this year studying at Ngee Ann Polytechnic's School of ICT.
        I chose to study in ICT's IT course because it offers a large variety of in-demand
        career pathways that I can choose from in the future. Furthermore i believe that
        programming will be an essential skill in the 21st Century and thus joining this
        course helps me to be more proficient in this valubale skill.
