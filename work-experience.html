        <li><h2>Panasonic Factory Solutions Asia Pacific</h2>
            During my time at Panasonic, the company was still new to the field
             of indoor farming. Together with the company, we experimented and
              found various ways and methods to improve our farming processes. 
              Through this role, I also managed to interact with people from other 
              countries with very different backgrounds that changed the perspectives 
              of my young self back then.</li>
        <li><h2>Amazon Prime Now</h2>
            Amazon Prime provided me experience with warehouse operations and 
            allowed me to understand and experience first-hand the processes 
            that a multinational online retail company take to handle large 
            amounts of orders daily. Through working there i also learned 
            inventory and stock-taking methods that will be relevant if I am 
            to work in a similar industry in the future.</li>
